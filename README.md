Coming from a city where it rains over 300 days per year, I miss those rainy nights more
than anything else. Over the years whenever I feel sad, I would sit by my window and
hear the pitter patter of raindrops drifting into my ears, like a friend pouring their heart
out to me. I would write down all my worries on a piece of paper, then reach out of my
window and let the rain blur my words, just like someone is listening to and crying with
me. That magical experience would always make me feel so much better.

Nowadays itâ€™s harder to feel comfortable pouring our hearts out or finding someone who
will listen to us. Therefore, I want to bring my magical rainy night here so people can
share their thoughts anonymously through those falling raindrops; Catching raindrops
while falling lets you listen to the thoughts of others from all over the world.
On the technical side, express, Node.js, socket.io, p5.js are used to create the clientserver
communication-After viewer send a message from its phone to the server, the
message will be written to a json file which is later parsed by Processing program using
an URL. With the help of kinect2 depth camera I am able to let the rain drops fall on the
viewers despite of noisy backgrounds. This is the last project during my undergrad here
and no doubt one of the most challenging projects that I made.
